**Cloud & AI Engineer | Backend Systems | Production AI Products**

🎯 **Check out my [Portfolio](https://nirvaan.dev)!**  

I design, build, and operate **production-grade backend systems and AI-powered products**, with hands-on experience across **cloud infrastructure, scalable APIs, and data-driven pipelines**. I've owned features end-to-end - from system design and implementation to deployment, monitoring, and iteration in real production environments.

## What I Do

▸ Design and ship **backend services** using FastAPI, Docker, and AWS  
▸ Build **AI-powered features** using LLMs, RAG pipelines, embeddings, and APIs  
▸ Design and operate **cloud-backed systems** (EC2, S3, IAM, SES) with security and reliability in mind  
▸ Own **production workflows** CI/CD, environment configuration, debugging, and monitoring  
▸ Translate ambiguous requirements into **reliable, shipped systems**
